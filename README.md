1.    In   a   factory   quality   control process,   two   machines   are   responsible   for   producing   parts. Ma-   chine   1,   represented   by   the   random   variable   X,   produces   parts   with   quality   scores   ranging   from   3   to   6, depending on   various   factors    like precision and material used. Machine    2,   represented   by   the   random   variable   Y,   produces   parts   with   quality   scores   ranging   from   3   to 5.   These   quality   scores   are   crucial   for   maintaining   the   overall   quality   of the   production   line,   as   poor   scores   from   either   machine   can   lead   to   defects   or   product   failures. Your   task   is   to   model   the   joint   distribution   of   the   quality   scores   for   these   two   machines,   considering both   their individual    performance and their relationship   to each other. This   model   can   be   used   to   understand   how   one   machine’s   performance   affects   the   other   and   to   predict   outcomes   in   different   conditions.Let    X      and    Y       be    two    discrete      random    variables,      where      X       has    the      possible      outcomes   {3,   4, 5, 6}   (the   quality   scores   of   Machine    1)   and   Y    has   the    possible    outcomes    {3,   4, 5}   (the   quality   scores   of   Machine   2).
a.    Construct   a   bivariate   probability   mass   function pX,Y    :   {3,   4,   5,   6}   × {3,   4,   5} →   R   that satisfies   both   of the   following   conditions: [15    marks] 
(i)    The   expected   quality   score   of   Machine   1   is   E[X]   = 4.5.
(This   represents   the   average   performance   of Machine   1,   giving   an   idea   of how   it   performs   over   time.)
(ii)    The   expected    quality   score   of   Machine   2,   given   that    Machine    1’s    score    is   4,    is   E[Y   |   X   = 4]   = 4.6,   i.e.,   the   conditional   expectation   of   Y   given   that   x   = 4.
(This showshow Machine 2 performs   when   Machine   1 produces apart   with   a score   of 4.    It   reveals   any   dependencies   between   the   machines.)
b.    Calculate   the   covariance    and   correlation   for   your   chosen   distribution   constructed   for   part   (a).
(These   measures   show   whether   and   how   the   performance   of Machine   1   and   Machine
2   are   related,   and   how strong   that   relationship   is.) [10    marks]

2.    Imagine   you   are   a   data   analyst   working   on   a    project   for   a   logistics   company   that   manages   deliveries   across   multiple   regions.      Each   day,   the   company   collects   data   on   various   aspects   of the   delivery   process   to   optimise   efficiency   and   reduce   costs.    Three   key   random   variables,   X   ,   Y   and   Z,   represent   different   metrics:
•    X   represents the number of successful deliveries made out of 10 attempts on a particular   route,    where    each    delivery    has    a    50%    chance    of    success.          This    follows    a      binomial   distribution.
•    Y   represents the   number of delivery attempts   needed   before the first   successful   delivery   occurs   on   a   challenging   route,   where   each   attempt   has   a   40%   chance   of success.    This   follows   a   geometric   distribution.
•    Z    represents    the   total    number   of   customer   orders   received   in   a   specific   region   on   a   given   day,   with   an   average   of   4   orders   per   day.   This   follows   a   Poisson   distribution.
Let   X   ,   Y   ,   and   Z   be   independent   random   variables   whose   distributions   are   given   by:   X   ~ Bin(10,   0.5),                   Y   ~   Geo(0.4),                     Z   ~ Po(4).
a.    Plot   the    probability    mass   functions    (PMFs)   of   the   distributions   for   X   ,   Y    and   Z    in   ONE   figure   with   three   subplots,   using   the   same   x-axis   range   for   all   subplots.
(This helps you   visualise   the   behaviour of   the   three   different metrics and compare   their   likelihoods.) [3 marks] 
b.    Find   a   combination   of   X   ,   Y    and   Z   whose   expectation   equals √e   (where   e   is   Euler’s   number)   and   whose   variance   is   π   2   .
(This could be   useful   for modelling a   new metric   that   meets specific statistical   require-   ments   for predicting   future   deliveries.) [10 marks] 
c.    Find   a   combination   of   X   ,   Y   and   Z   whose   expectation   is   equal   to   its   variance.
(This   helps   identify   cases   where   the   variability   matches   the   average   代 写5CCE2NMS: Numerical and Statistical Methods Coursework 2Java

For    instance,    in    a    delivery   system,    if   the    expectation    equals   the   variance,   it   suggests   the   process   is   stable   and   predictable.    A   balanced   route   with   steady deliveries   means   fewer   fluctuations   that   make   the   system   easier   to   manage   and   less   prone   to   disruptions.)) [5 marks] 
d.    Compute   the   covariance   of the   resulting   variable   in   part   (c)   with   Z.
(This allows you   to   understand how the   new metric from part   (c)   relates   to   the   number   of customer   orders   Z.    It gives   insight   into   how   deliveries   depend   on   demand.)

3.    A   company   operates   a   customer   service   system   where   a   customer   request   is   handled   by   four   different   departments:   A   (Initial   Support),   B   (Technical   Team),   C   (Billing),   and   D   (Man-   ager   Escalation).   The   probabilities   of   a   customer   issue   being   handled   by   these   departments   stabilise   over   time   and   the   long-term   behaviour   is   described   by   the   following   probabilities:
p∞ (A → A) = 0.1,          p∞ (A   →   B)   =   0.4,          p∞ (A   →   C)   = 0.2,            p∞ (A   →   D)   =   0.3.This   scenario   can    be    modelled    using   a    Markov   chain,   where   the   customer    request    moves   between   departments   according   to   a   set   of   transition    probabilities.       You    are    tasked   with   constructing   and   analysing   this   Markov   chain.
a.    Construct a   Markov chain with four   states   {A,B,C,   D}   representing   the   departments,   such that the   long-term transition   probabilities   from   state   A   match those   given   above.   Present   the   transition   matrix   and   draw   the   diagram   of the   resulting   Markov   chain.    In   the   transition   matrix,   the   value   in   Column   i   and   Row   j   represents   the   probability   of   transitioning   from   state   si    to   state   sj .(The   transition   matrix should show   the   probabilities   of   a   customer   request   being   han-   dled   by   each   department,   and   the   diagram   will   help   visualise   how   the   request   moves   through   the   system.) [13 marks] 
b.    What is(are) the most likely   path(s) for a customer request to   move from   Initial Support   (A)   to   Billing   (C)   within   4   time   steps   or   fewer   in   your   proposed   Markov   chain?
(This   analysis   helps   determine   the   most   probable   route   the   request   will   take   through   the   departments   within   a   limited   number of   steps.) [4 marks] 
c.    Modify the   Markov chain   by   introducing a   fifth   state   E   to   represent   an   external   consul-   tant   that   sometimes   handles   customer   requests.    In   this   case,   the   long-term   behaviour   is   such   that   p∞ (E   →   E)   =   0,   but   at   any   given   time   step   k   >   0,   the   probability   of   staying   in   state   E   is   non-zero:    pk (E   →   E)  0.      Draw   the   updated   diagram   of   the   Markov   chain.
(This   addition   reflects   situations   where   a   request   is   temporarily passed   to   an   external   consultant   but   will   eventually   return   to   the   internal   team.) [8 marks]

4.                a.    In    a    board   game,   success    may   depend   on   rolling   a   specific   number   on   a   die   multiple   times.   You   are   rolling   a   fair   six-sided   die   and   need   to   determine   how   many   trials   it   will   take   to   roll   the   number   ‘1’   exactly   s   times,   with   the   restriction   that   the   first   roll   is   not   a   ‘1’   .   What   is   the   probability   that   it   takes   exactly   n   rolls   to   achieve   this   outcome?
(This   scenario   helps   analyse   the   likelihood   of reaching   a   specific   number   of   successes   in   a   game   with   the   consideration   of   a   restriction   on   the   first   trial.) [15 marks] 
b.    In   a    network    management   setting,   server   reliability   is   crucial.    Suppose   a   server    has   a   probability   of going   down   once   every   10   days,   modelled   by   a   Poisson   distribution,   with   the   probability   of   a   single   downtime   being   0.1.   What   is   the   probability   that   the   server   will   experience   exactly   5   downtimes   in   a   365-day   period?
(This situation   models server reliability over   time,   helping plan   for maintenance   sched-   ules   and system   downtime   management.)
